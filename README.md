Goal: 
- To automate the login process of several sites that I access on a daily basis
- Saves time and was a cool starter project

UPDATE: 
- Goal Accomplished




Next Steps:
- Develop a script that eliminates certain ads on websites that AdBlocker cannot# AutomateLogins

UPDATE:
- Next steps not beneficial to user because the script stops working once it does it tasks. In order to block the ads, the script must run continously. Therefore, I am not pursuing the next steps at this time.




Project Learning Take Aways:
- Selenium automation skills developed
- Stronger understanding of website programs and code achieved
- Got used to Git Commands
